If you want to use this for whatever reason you might have to modify it slightly to work with your game engine or whatever of choice, I tried to make it pretty general but it can be improved for certain engines of whatever.

I have tried to stop using this as I feel it adds more boilerplate then needed it can be great but for calling functions I prefer to have something like an actions.cs that contains a bunch of static actions that get subscribed to by whatever needs them to get called by them.
